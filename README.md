# `como_command_line`


Command-line version of the CoMo model.  


Tests
-----

Templates for v17 of the CoMo model are taken from the [CoMo github](https://github.com/ocelhay/como/tree/1b61938191d9f63d512a3aaec9f5271a3ca0ed5a).  The file `Template_CoMoCOVID-19App_v17.xlsx` is available for download from that link.  This was process with V17.2 of the Shiny App to generate the output file `COVID19_App_Data_Template_CoMoCOVID-19App_v17.csv` against which the command-line invocation is compared.
